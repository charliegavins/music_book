Foreward/Background of Author

After eight years as a ‘professional’ in the music business, I’ve stepped back to reflect, digest and assimilate. The best way I can think about reconciling this journey is by writing down my experiences, learnings and conclusions. If the sole purpose is simply to satisfy an unresolved inner dissonance, to make sense of a trip to both the stars and hell and back then it will be a satisfying task. Normally this would be a self-serving exercise for the early retiree, which, I suppose is where I stand at the moment whilst writing this, having just turned 26 and cut all ties with the business I gave my life to.

Up to the age of about 15, the musicians and artists that I listened to could only be placed into one category, that of untouchable ‘gods’. In my mind they possessed talents and powers way beyond those that could be classed as regular mortal people. Their command of this magic ability to weave intricate and subtle musical tapestries into a form that would resonate deeply with others who had no specialist knowledge of the format didn’t seem from this world. 

That was until a long solo train ride which I always looked forward to as an opportunity to get completely lost in an activity without distraction. More often than not, that activity was listening to music. Today was different - something in the music did something that changed my whole perspective. It was a pivotal moment where in one instant, I saw a complete shift in the way I saw music and those individuals that created it. At the time I didn’t see the significance of the song I was listening to while this happened - nor fully appreciated how my thinking had changed, but I’ve since looked back on that one moment of insight as something that has shaped my last decade and fully inspired a change in life approach.

I had the realisation that there was nothing fundamentally different between me and the ‘gods’ that I had been listening to - that the song I was listening to was simply made by another mortal human (albeit very clearly ‘talented’, the definition of which we will address later).

More clearly than ever before, the song deconstructed itself in front of me, and gave me what was like an X-ray into the mechanics of the production itself - I found myself isolating the individual parts of the record, the vinyl crackle, gospel samples, piano riff and others in my mind and how they all worked together across the stereo field and what effects were added to make it all gel and create the desired overall effect. It was as if the curtain in the emerald city had been pulled across to leave the Wizard of Oz pulling at his levers!

What must have encouraged this new view was the music itself, the opening track off of Fatboy Slim’s album Palookaville - Don’t Let The Man - which opens with the sample: ‘And the sign said long hair freaky people need not apply’. A sentiment that was sampled from the original song ‘Signs’ by Five Man Electrical Band, deploring the presence of man made rules in our world. Fatboy’s trademark beats and bass straight from the spawn of 90’s rave took this sentiment up a few notches and gave me the feeling that blueprints and moulds shouldn’t and needn’t be adhered to. It was the magic key that unlocked my heart and showed me anything was possible- this sentiment, alongside this new way of looking at music kick started a process of hyper concentration on one goal - to work in music.

I found the passion and direction with which to direct my energies came easily after this point - I looked for any books I could get my hands on, subscribed to the more affordable ‘subscription trials’ of music week (the UK trade magazine for the music business) and started getting closer and closer to bands at school who needed their guitar amps carrying to and from rehearsals and in and out of dingy venues. Alongside this, I started making my own music. I had done this before using free to download software but I started getting inducted on the depth of logic pro. Not really musical in the traditional sense, I found myself disconnected with music lessons. It was only when the capabilities of production were shown to me, which seemed to treat music in a much more intuitive and obvious way than classical scores, that I was away - spending hours in the school rehearsal room that had been converted with a brand new (at the time) mac and logic pro - reading the manual, but mostly learning by trial and error what worked and what didn’t. If music was my passion before, it had now become a way of life.

Alongside all of these efforts was a different part of my life - that of school and soon conversations were being had about careers and specialisation. This subject which baffles most people of that age is one that to me felt wholly unnatural - there were many things I enjoyed and wanted to spend time on. It was hard to understand how I could reconcile my love for the creative freedom in art, with the interest I had in the sciences and humanities into four subject options (AS Levels). Not wanting to pick subjects that I felt would ‘hold me back’ in the real world, I picked Physics, Maths and Economics - probably the subjects I found the hardest and enjoyed the least, but those that I felt as a result must be the best to choose. The fourth option I picked was a relatively new course of music technology.

The last year of school was a drag. Spending any spare waking minute in the studio making beats, producing bands and helping others with their productions, I wanted to leave and get on with music full time. It should have come as no surprise that having received some offers to go to university to study Economics and Business, I turned them all down and headed out into the world keen to work with musicians who share the same passion as I.

Introduction

How to make it in music. This is a subject fraught with difficulty, yet it is something that I think can, and should, be discussed in a meaningful and hopefully enlightening way. 

’Music’ still has a debated definition. ‘Make it’ depends on who you are and what your circumstances are.  

So, for this purpose, what I will aim to do in the following chapters is to lay out the landscape in an as impartial way as possible, yes, explaining what it takes to become a superstar, but also explaining what it takes to be a real artist, and fully preparing you for the conflicts and battles you will encounter along the way. This book should be as much inspiration as caution but the main aim is to shed some light into the dark ‘unknowable’ world of music, the ‘business’ and creativity.

I have crafted these insights so that they can be useful not only to those that are planning on being musicians and artists, but to those who feel their calling is to help those artists flourish. Alongside this, the tools and observations are universally applicable, thus apply to today’s established musicians and executives, who should also find it useful. I suggest to them that they pick a header in the index that interests them and dive in from there.This book should be particularly relevant for those people who are deeply entrenched in the current industry yet feel an inner dissonance that the way things are aren’t quite right but can’t see where to turn. For the old timers - I hope you find something here. For those currently uninitiated - welcome.

I have compiled a collection of tools that you can use at your discretion as you navigate your own journey. It is certainly not a rule book, and the information I give won’t be like putting together a piece of furniture, or completing a crossword. In this world of musical dreams, A+B might equal C a few times, but it will then fast equal Z, then Y another, so a mechanical template simply doesn’t work. This journey is as much about learning how stuff works as it is understanding yourself; the difference between knowledge and knowing is very important. 

You’re going to need to find it within yourself so some sections will resonate, and others won’t - I suggest you pick up and run with those that do, and not get hung up with those inevitable ones that don’t.

I am writing this book, because of an innate need for the power of music to be realised, and this information is not, as far as I have seen, commonly available and there is no reason it shouldn’t be. Whether the conclusions and advice contained in these pages is absolutely correct to you specifically, I would encourage all who work in music, and those who are getting into it, to follow this lead in questioning every facet of the status quo. If there were even just a handful of people willing to risk everything and do things in a new way, this could pave the way for something incredible, and unlock the full potential of this fantastic medium.

What is Music?

Study the concept of music for any length of time and it will soon dawn on you that this isn’t something that can be treated in a way that we’re encouraged to at school, or in wider society - it’s very existence comes into doubt if you change the point of focus; Try to define it and you will be frustrated at either the vagueness of the phrase [#R] or the overly specific [#R]. It is this elusive property that gives us a hint to what music really is - if it can’t be pinned down in a way that rock, wood and even water and fire can, then it is clear a different thought process is required to deal with this slippery substance.

To take this from another angle - if the answer to our question give us unsatisfactory answers, then could it be that we’re asking the wrong question, or that something within the question is tripping this up? Defining something asks for its boundaries to be drawn between what it is, and what it is not. ‘That’ is a cat, it is an animal with these certain characteristics [#R definition of cat]. The problem here is that music is paradoxical in that it is quite a lot (everything), or not much at all (nothing). There is not a part of the world, or universe, where music is, and music is not.

It seems then, that instead of music being a component of our reality - something that resides in our world and stands along other nouns that can be defined, I would suggest that music has a different property, and should be viewed along the same lines as consciousness, love and truth: a fundamental part of the construction in this universe. 

[#R find good, credible people that back up this argument]

Ultimately, if we are to delve deeper into it we’ll find the the very nature of rhythm, tempo, dissonance, harmony are all vitally important facets of creation itself.

Once you start looking at it from that foundational level - in a way that sees everything in ‘creation’ making its own music - it’s own rhythm, it starts to make sense - night, day, waxing, waning, spring, summer, autumn, winter. The passing of time and events which intersect and punctuate it throughout history - the ocean and it’s waves, the skies and their winds. Rain, thunder and lightning. Monsoons and droughts. 

Sleep, wake. conception, birth. Growth, life and death - all have their own subtle rhythms and harmonics, from the most ancient of glaciers to the [#R short lifespan of something cute]

Flocks of birds and their flapping of wings, calls and the swooping and diving masses that they form [#R], crickets at night, rutting stags…patterings of creature’s footsteps in the undergrowth.

Monday mornings, kettles boiling, radio sets fuzzing, eggs cracking. Showers, brushes, combs, ties. Children running, buses spluttering. Street lights, train on tracks, car horns, shouts, laughter.

The trouble found with defining music is working out how to fit it into life, into our world - when the fact of the matter is that is IS our world, it IS our life. Music is life, and the whole of dances in it. It’s not just audible sound, it’s existence, expression, interaction, dance. 

It is all around us. 

The sun setting with beams of golden gaze darting through the wooden skies onto a leaf littered autumn dusk. The cliffs of a seaside town with waves crashing in, the gale howling through the streets. Flags desperately clinging onto their homes. Boats rocking and turning in the froth. A lighthouse remaining tall and firm - a calming point of constant reference to the chaos.

This is the music that we are discussing, it is the music of the universe, and the music of life. To separate this with sonics made by instruments and to say only that is music would be neglecting the subject’s core foundation. Only when we fully appreciate that music’s roots delve deep into the very depths of creation and is as much part of us as it is in the world around us can we even begin to start to treat it with the sacred reverence that is required for this endeavour.

Embracing, stroking, connection, affection.

It doesn’t stop here - there is more. Not only is it the physical expression of this world and those operating within it. Not only is it the sights, sounds, smells, tastes and feelings themselves - music is the expression of the unseen, the unspoken, the unsensed - it is the music of the interaction of each of us with these experiences - the dance of emotion and attachment to these transitory moments in time. The feelings that flow through us with these glorious happenings. It is the longing, loving, expectation, anticipation. It is not just the happenings but the happened and the yet to happen. It is the potential of what might or might not be. Here is when real meaning is behind the rhythms of life, when there is not only the dance, but also a dancer, taking all of it in. Music is with us in these moments, whether it just be in our own mind, or there in the flesh - music is with us always.

The music that we make and appreciate as individuals is a representation of what is all around us. We take a format, whether it be voice, guitar, or computer and through this limitation we express what we see.

We share things out of an inherent need to connect. Secrets, thoughts, emotions…poems, artwork…songs…we’re all artists in our own way. We are bold, brave and fearless. Our minds are racing when we let go of something deep, never sure whether the self judgement we subject ourselves to is too harsh, or even worse - too soft. 

Making music is about bearing all. You have an inner dissonance which needs to be brought out, and you turn to it in your time of need. 

Music is our way of exercising excess emotion which manifests as stress, anxiety…it is an emotional medicine of the greatest kind. 

Whether creating, curating or receiving…each has its valuable role to play in the music ecosystem.

And that’s what it is - a natural process between humanity which acts as our emotional social network - it binds us together and makes us realise that we’re not alone. 

Someone somewhere has felt the same as you.

It is our artists who let us dare to imagine something different. It’s our artists who, like the intrepid explorers of our world, braving the dangers of the jungle, risk it all by living on the edge, exploring the unchartered territories of emotion to report back with specimens that inspire and move. Music is our imagination, our collective heart and our soul. Without it we are lost, depressed, submissive, hopeless. Don’t believe me and watch any film without its soundtrack - and you’ll soon see any colour and emotional dimension is lost - translate that to our world and you’ll realise how much music is an integral part of what makes us who we are.

This world isn’t necessarily visible, but it is no less real than the one we occupy now. It is the world of emotion and poetry - that of love, hate and everything in-between. 

The Bigger Picture

The bigger picture here is important. In the same way that ecosystems are collapsing around the globe, our world’s explorers and scientists despairing at the destruction, the parallels are happening elsewhere. Whilst less tangible and visible, the artistic space and ecosystem that we have grown to love and rely on is in serious jeopardy. Our flowers and trees, birds and bees of hopes, dreams, loves and fears that we have cultivated over thousands of years is crumbling in secret. Even our most loyal and strong dreamers are fighting daily battles just to keep afloat. 

Listeners are being sued for the lifesaving task of sharing songs that they love in the hope that others might benefit. Musicians are pouring their heart and soul into works for them only to be buried, never to see the light of day. Curators compiling the most incredible selections of gems from the farthest corners, only to be subject to legal takedown notices and their long-laboured channels to be blackmailed into submission. The environment that has treated us well for so long is turning dark.


Making Music

There are two distinct parts of the creation of music. There is the skill involved in mastering the particular format, whether that be piano, voice, saxophone or computer production, and the creativity itself.

Of course the interplay between these two aspects happens in such a way that often it seems like they are not separate at all, but for the purpose of this chapter, we will disect the processes at this point.

Mastery

There is a commonly coined term - 10,000 hours, that if you practice a craft for this amount of time, you will become a ‘master’ in it.

Good Vs. Bad:

It is hard to say what is ‘good’ or ‘bad’ music, because it is such a subjective thing. Also the suggestion that some types of music are ‘good’ would make the immediate assumption that others would have to be ‘bad’, which would mean we fall into the trap of trying to define music, which as we have already discovered is a tough tale. 

That said, I will lay out what is good and bad from where I stand. For illustration, I will use analogy of food. I have two burgers here for you to try. Burger A and Burger B. You try burger A, then take some water, and try burger B. I immediately ask you which you prefer, A or B. This is a subjective test of course, but I have built into it something that illustrates my point. For the sake of this argument you prefer burger A immediately after comparing the two. This will have a lot to do with your taste buds, and what they are telling the brain, alongside some textures and smells. Burger A is stronger and bolder tasting, with more extreme flavours, giving your brain the signal that it’s the much more tasty morsel. Burger B is subtler and less strong, with some slightly difficult flavours to process and a slightly dry bun.

When I ask you to take off the blind fold, you can see in front of you that burger A was in fact straight from McDonalds, yet burger B was carefully home made by yours truly, with entirely organic ingredients made from wild venison, rocket and garlic.

How can one judge? Food, as with music is all about the context that is involved - location, time of day, people you’re with, environment (light/dark/hot/cold/), and the ritual that is involved - the ingredients used, the mechanical order in which they are blended together, and how they are heated.

How do you judge which is ‘better’? I say that the best way of judging is what best leaves you fully nourished - body mind and soul. Maybe your taste buds don’t appreciate it quite so much, but your body will, and certainly 2 hours after the better meal, your mind will be feeling more alert.

Music is even harder to quantify in this case than food, because there are no real obvious physical chemical reactions that go on, beyond stimulations in the brain, and some responses from that. 



	

Identity

The balance between two extremes - being overly conscious of this makes you too focussed on what is outside of you, but then not being mindful of it will mean that you don’t accurately communicate your intentions.

The truth about marketing

Getting the word out to your fans is easy - or it should be - maybe some new age marketing should be explored here
The best way to make new fans is to make good music and get it out to the existing fans
Major label marketing spends money to get new fans. These people are not good quality people, fickle and bump up the numbers and sales in a way that isn’t sustainable.

Music and Money

Can I make a living doing what I love? The word career is out of date and shouldn’t be used
How do I navigate the business side of this? I’m no good at it!

Making money - the psychological block that money provides is more often than not an illusion of security. [Research]

“And if there come the singers and the dancers and the flute-players - buy of their gifts also. For they too are the gatherers of fruit and frankincense, and that which they bring, though fashioned of dreams, is raiment and food for your soul” - The Prophet, Kahlil Gibran

“The cultivation and expansion of needs is the antithesis of wisdom. It is also the antithesis of freedom and peace. Every increase of needs tends to increase one’s dependence on outside forces over which one cannot have control, and therefore increases existential fear. Only by a reduction of needs can one promote a genuine reduction in those tensions which are the ultimate causes of strife and war.”- E. F. Schumacher, Small Is Beautiful

Making money

Is there an innate need to make money? Often money is mistaken as the goal because it’s the main perceived barrier between desires and wants. Unless, however you are suffering from an insufficiency in the base level of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, money should NOT hold you back - even at the base level, money only satisfies a short term need. When is ‘enough’? When can one feel completely materially secure? I think we’ve read enough about the 1% to know that the answer is never if you enter into that game. The best way to look at it is whether you have enough security, in either a paid job or savings to be secure for the next 6-12 months.

Being an artist is a way of life, not a career path. Treating it like a mechanical endeavour is possible, but directly affects the power of the music.

Music doesn’t fit well into an economic system - in economics the definitions of all four categories don’t seem to have music fit like a glove. Various resources put it down as a tertiary, alongside other entertainment with  

The Current Business Landscape.

Major record companies are making less profits due to piracy. As far as I see it, the story doesn’t end there. This is an illusion - this is a false front to the real problem behind the headlines of Pirate Bay getting stormed, Kim Dotcom being exiled, and 14 year olds getting sued for uploading their favourite songs [#R citation needed].

There was a time where centralised marketing and distribution made a lot of sense. Combining resources for more leverage with the few media gatekeepers and much larger buying power to get down the unit cost of CDs or vinyl. To get a record deal was to open you up to these opportunities. Because people couldn’t find out about music in any other way, they would read a good review in NME or watch a band on MTV, it might resonate, and they would buy the physical copy. Music companies grew exponentially off the back of this with huge, abnormal profits.

So, now in present day, when the problem of decentralised international distribution has been essentially solved, through peer to peer file distribution networks of which the most prominent are torrents and the internet has meant that no longer do the traditional gatekeepers of old wield so much power - what are these companies used for, and why do artists keep signing to them?

To answer this question, we need to remember that there are decades of in built systems and processes in this industry. Artists and their companies have been operating in the same way for a long time. As new technology and possibilities have arisen, instead of the affairs being completely re-imagined, they have simply occupied more lines in the legal paperwork surrounding these artist/label agreements (which are now on average around 40 pages [#R citation needed]. Although it might surprise you, most people in the industry take the status quo as gospel and don’t question how things are done. There is a reason for that, and it’s mainly because there is no financial incentive to change - whether it was intentional or not (my belief is that it isn’t), but any company that is interested in making money out of music has by its very nature to be rigged against the artist. The current industry is based on some fundamental flaws about how artistry and music are treated, and structured in a way that might have been appropriate before the rise of the digital age. It has all changed in the last 15 years, and whilst executives and media might be still weeping and longing for yesteryear, I can’t say I’ve heard up coming musicians wining about the state of affairs.

How up coming artists fit into this landscape.

So you have honed your format, instruments and or voice, and you’ve developed a creative ability for expression, in a way that works for you. You’ve worked hard enough, and failed enough times, and it seems that your music is resonating with those closest to you, and is spreading to people that you don’t know, whether that be through shows or online. This is a key moment. You should be very proud of yourself - what you have achieved is no mean feat. At the same time, like the end of a roll of sellotape, blink and you’ll lose it, so be careful about your decisions here.

For sake of argument, people need $1500 a month to live. You can get by on less, but in a main city such as London or Los Angeles, this is about minimum. Let’s say one way or another you’ve managed to find that, either through a part time job, through the music itself or you have a lump of money saved up. Or you’re a student, still living at home, or have managed to find some other way on scraping by with just about $0. You should be doubly proud of yourself - you’ve got yourself a great situation - for the foreseeable future (6 months or so) there is nothing that more money can bring you other than minor life improvements and luxuries (yes, that bit of production equipment or guitar at this stage is a luxury). You can make the music you love to make, and pay the bills (or not have any). Things might not be ‘comfortable’, but you get by, and you have a good time doing so. What, in this scenario needs to change? If you are intensely ambitious, then you might say everything. This is not enough - you want more. I wouldn’t blame you for thinking that, but materially, everything works for now.

It’s often at this stage when artists start getting approached by people, either online as messages, or people turning up at shows. There are a whole host of positions out there in music that make money from what artists do. Lawyers, Pluggers, Record labels, agents, but the ones that are normally the first to make contact are the managers. The manager’s business is simple - they find up and coming artists, and provide them initially with expertise, contacts, sounding board. They are often great at sales and for an artist who has been focussing on just doing his/her/their thing, this person that comes into their life might seem like a superman - what you can get me X or Y opportunity that I’ve always dreamed of? You know my main inspiration/idol personally? wow. At the same time, what might be twitching inside is - what do you actually do? how do you fit into my life? how can I trust you? I’ve got this far, why do I need you?

Money might be the main issue that you feel is holding you back from your wildest dreams. You have a crappy guitar. You’re sofa surfing and run out of favours. You’ve unintentionally memorised the cheapest things on the menu in your local chicken cottage [#R need an international equivalent here]. You feel like one more day at the day job will finish you off. Someone has entered your life and seems to have all the solutions to your daily struggle. This person has credentials (or seems to), experience and knowledge. You might also be in a position where your confidence is at an all time low, your parents don’t support this endeavour, and whilst you have passionate friends urging you to continue, you feel like music can’t be for you, why are you wasting your time. A manager comes in, and justifies your existence, it legitimises your exploits.

BEWARE. These are all external factors that are coming into your life - solution to money or confidence. As discussed in previous chapters, these things have the potential to have an affect on the art.

It is at this point where your options are more than you might think. Even at this early stage in your career, you have to make one of the biggest decisions. The decision isn’t just which manager (after all, you’ve always quite liked the idea of having a ‘manager’ - doesn’t that justify my existence as an artist?), or even do I want a manager. It’s do I NEED a manager.

This decision is big, and many artists don’t find out until years later how big, and for what reasons.

Let’s start with the financials of this engagement:

Artist - needs roughly $1500 per month to survive
Manager - needs roughly $1500 per month to survive.

Managers charged a fixed rate of between 10-20% of gross. Some more, some less (remember, there are no rules here).

So, for you as an artist to be worth a manager’s while, you need to be either making £10-20,000 per month income, or the manager takes on more artists. On that basis though, say he takes on five artists, each at one day a week, no longer is this person going to be able to spend much time with you. In fact - is that a good deal? one day a week for 10-20%? 

You might be lucky, and get a manager who has some savings, or just one very established act, which allows him/her to have more time and resources at his disposal, but they will be looking for a return at some point, and probably higher - or it just won’t be worth their while.

A five to ten times jump in revenue to justify your new team member seems out of this world - how could that be possible? You’ve heard of musicians making lots of money, but you have no idea how to get it to that level. 

The manager knows this, and there is a tried and tested route to make it worth his while - more often than not it will involve a major record company. 

The person who not only is by now your good friend and biggest fan, but also is your lens into the strategic and business side of your musical operation might suggest that the best strategy moving forward is to look for a record deal or strategic partnership.

To break down how a standard deal looks - see below:

Total advanced: £110,000
Taken from advance:
		legal fees						£10,000 
		20% manager cut after legal fees	£20,000
		Accountancy fees				£1000
Total:								£89,000

This might still look like a lot of money, but more often than not this not only needs to pay for you to live while you’re working hard to get your project off the ground, but also it will need to go into investing in a live show, equipment and other things. Above all, it is an advance, so it’s simply a loan - you are spending your future earnings.

So, to summarise, you now have a manager who needs you to be earning a lot of money per month in a couple of years to make it worthwhile. You have also just signed a record deal. This takes the financial heat off both you and your manager for now - he has enough to justify his work, and so do you. The problems with this deal that you have just done are quite numerous:

1. Labels sign a lot of things that don’t ‘work’ financially [why can be discussed elsewhere]. On average only about 1 in 10 artists succeed to break even [#R]. This means that for your project they aren’t just looking to make their investment back off you (recording and marketing costs), but they are looking to make a huge return to justify many of their other failed attempts, in order to balance their books. 

2. The people at labels are good at their job and work longer hours than most people in most industries [#R], but they are locked into an impossible structure - imagine a job which requires you to take huge financial risks on things which defy all rational thinking. You are going to want to keep your job, so you will aim to sign artists who you think have most chance of having a biggest impact - this means you need to get on the radio.

With the speed and disposable culture of today’s connected world, radio is having to work hard to retain the attention of the growing, tech savvy demographic. It is doing this using metrics such as shazam, which prove a song/artists’ ability to make ears prick up and ‘earworms’, but it doesn’t automatically encourage real communication and story telling. The filter in a lot of ways actively removes this good stuff.

Artists and their corresponding A&Rs have a touch choice - either continue to make music that comes most naturally to them, or to develop their sound in a way that appeals to the gate keepers of old, and their unnatural filtration systems.

Radio is a hugely powerful tool for discovery but if it is responsible for artists making creative concessions, we will be left with:

- Short lived artistic careers - Unsustainable due to creative sacrifices leading to being disconnected with the project and resulting lack of motivation [#R See section on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation]

- Lack of creative consistency/Too many cooks - instead of artists focussing internally, music is produced by committee

- Sonics over message - how the record sounds is put much higher above the built in sentiment - this is the wrong way round. [#J point needs justification]

- Lack of diversity - to earn a living when needing to appeal to gatekeepers, artists take less risks and don’t push music forward

- Fundamentally the audience is dictating what is being produced, rather than the other way around.

The further and further pressure you are put under to perform financially, the more strain you will feel creatively, and this is a dangerous place to be.

So, going back to the big decision - do you take a manager or not? I would say that if in doubt the answer should be no. And the answer to the three month trial offer should also be a polite no.

The fundamental flaw that we keep making is treating products of the imagination as physical things. We try to fit them into economic structures - ‘entertainment’ is apparently a tertiary industry as far as economics is concerned, to be filed alongside retail etc [#R needed]. 

Can I make a living helping those creators?

Epilogue: Unlocking music’s huge potential, and what making it means to me

I have made this epilogue as a separate section to the main body of this book, because it is less impartial than the rest.

I’ve had enough of people talking about the ‘music industry in decline’. I’ve also seen and heard enough about artists frustrated with the current way of doing things. I have also seen first hand the dire state that the current structures are in. I need to write down my manifesto for the future. 

[list of artists who have fallen out with their record label]

You could put this down to artists who are erratic, greedy, untrusting, and put faith in the companies who ‘made them who they are’. I’ll let you judge for yourself.

Let me get down the company/artist arrangement in as broad and as simple terms as possible:

In recording contracts, artists are viewed as suppliers. 

Artists supply ‘goods’ to the company (tracks) in return for marketing money and a loan against the record sales (advance). Major record companies also tend to require 10-25% of all other income (live, merchandise, etc). Some go further and want everything from anything to do with an artists future career. Once this loan is paid back, the company still takes around 80% of the gross revenue from record sales.


Very rarely do companies guarantee what they are going to invest into marketing - it will be at their sole discretion. 

Opinion based judgements on how we can operate to see in a new golden era of music making. The change will be hard, and will not be for everyone - but if you have made it this far into the book, I encourage you to read through. 

- Decentralised distribution 
- Decentralised remuneration
- Finance/Art uncoupling
- Personel streamlining 
- Preorder album before it’s written
- Buy tickets for tour before it’s confirmed
- No contracts
- No percentages?


The Solution

Imagining nothing exists and re-building music from zero, using universal laws of nature to ensure that the system is as sustainable and conducive to expression as possible.

This is not a solution to those that want to be famous - that involves a completely different strategy, and I would argue fame isn’t in line with the laws of nature [quotes here on fame, adele etc]. This is for people who want to make music primarily because it helps them, and then secondarily because it resonates with others, and trusting that a bi product of it all will enable them to meet their musical commitments, through side income, or from money from the music itself.

The music and the money should be completely uncoupled because of reasons stated in previous chapters.

Music is something that is therapy for you - it provides you with satisfaction, joy, relieves stress and dissonance. You can’t imagine your life without it, and writing what flows through you feels like an important part of your life. Alongside this, others are benefitting from this music. When money is coupled to it, it slowly ceases to be either of these things to the world. In the past that was possible with bigger profit margins - it was harder to notice - but not now.

So - how to make a living? The most natural thing would be to charge for people to have access to this medicine - this stuff that helps people feel a certain way. Why not treat it like something physical? That would be very well if music acted like something physical. The problem is, it doesn’t. With the advent of the internet, infinite copies can be made and distributed, even if you go through great pains to put up pay walls and DRM protected files - as soon as something is audible and playable through a set of speakers and headphones, it can be copied at near enough exactly the same quality and then distributed for free. This strange effect which has happened to art products of the imagination isn’t the reason why we shouldn’t charge, but it certainly removes the long term business model for those that do.

What about streaming services like spotify? Are we not at a new dawn? 

If you believe that 30% of the revenue made from something you poured your life and soul into  should go to a VC funded tech company which is mainly owned by [goldman sachs] citation needed, then fine. Executives worth over $300m for music distribution companies when the simplest and most efficient ones can do it for free doesn’t make any sense to me.

There are laws against this though, that is illegal and people shouldn’t do it, it’s our livelihood!

As soon as we are relying on our archaic governmental system to justify our revenue stream, I would become very worried. Isn’t music meant to transcend legislation I would also argue that the deterrents haven’t worked. And hang on a second, we are punishing people for sharing music? WHAT? That’s something that we encourage - that is a good thing! And yet this same rule doesn’t apply when artists are popular? How does that make any sense at all - no wonder fan bases are disengaging - the structure is fundamentally confusing.

Interesting point about livelihood - you should either still have that part time job, or have enough money to get by - you don’t NEED more. Hold out though - it gets better - it just might take some faith to get there.

So, in the long run, people can get the music if they want to, for free, whatever you do. 

So - what now? Well the answer I suggest that is the only answer which truly decouples art from the manipulative claws of money, is to become more like a charity than a business. You only accept anonymous donations. The distribution of digital files is carried out by torrents, and the distribution of physical formats is based on a kickstarter type thing - enough demand for a physical product, and it can be made. 

Physical product is important but we live in a world where we can ensure that there is no waste - so let’s do that! CD and vinyl on demand, or crowd sourcing.

Instead of prosecuting people for sharing, they should be rewarded. Each torrent has a tracker built into it for who seeded how much and when - if you want to be anonymous that’s ok, but it allows for there to be a metric to show how much of the international distribution of your favourite artist is down to you. No money changes hands, but as we’ve discovered, money can’t buy this kind of karma! Say a torrent is running slow for users, and they can’t stream it - quickly people can be notified to jump online and help out - how good will they feel?! What an awesome community of fans that will be helping each other out.

When you have gigs - they aren’t just looking at you - they are all looking at each other as friends who have all helped to share the love!

So, some hypothetical examples:

1. Person downloads, listens, loves it, continues to listen but doesn’t donate - do you have a problem with this? I would suggest no, as you will be ticking your fundamental box of getting music out there and resonating. Do you think this person might have bought the music anyway? 

2. Person downloads, listens, loves it, continues to listen and donates - do you have a problem with this? Maybe - you might be so selfless that you don’t feel you deserve the money - that is fine, but i would suggest that money is as much a token of positivity than a medium of exchange - you might never touch it, or give it away to other musicians, but see it as a 

3. Company uses your music in an advert for television that gets heard by millions of people, and doesn’t pay a cent for the usage, and doesn’t even ask your permission. This would be a very interesting case - because the company intends to make money from the usage (albeit indirectly), they are in the wrong here. I would like to suggest a quiet word with your fans explaining their foul play would solve the problem and stop that happening again. There is nothing quite like public shame. This might happen once or twice with this method, but soon enough companies will understand that they should get express permission from the artist, and should probably donate for the privilege. This will encourage a much more open and honest relationship.

4. If you would like to make a project happen, and need a lump sum that you can’t currently afford - then set up a public fund for people to contribute to, like kickstarter - you’ll fast see whether there is a demand for what you want to make. What is in it for the donors? Well, not only will they get to see a product that they want made, but also they get a credit in the record - if you need £1000 to make a recording and someone contributes £10, then they can safely say they contributed towards 1% of that successful project. Who needs more kudos than that? And because its available for the public domain, there are no ownership issues. Sure if you have samples, labels might continue to try to prosecute, and have links taken down - but they will be fighting a losing battle.

Songs should be released, with no expectation of any money in return - anyone who likes them must have something in common with you as a creator, so the more people you can help connect, the better.

There are two types of people in the world at the moment - those that pay for music, and those that don’t.

This art form is sacred, and its being abused, and we’re all paying the price.

Our ‘product’ used to be one which brought people together - more powerful than anything. We got into music because of the likes of Pink Floyd, Bob Marley, The Beatles, Bob Dylan….The Sex Pistols. Cultural goliaths who shaped who we all are today. Now it’s an afterthought at festivals which are more about selfie sticks, branded man bags and fake ray bans, funded and curated by companies that don’t care about anything other than profit. Radio stations which are only interested in selling adverts, so the more ‘sticky’ the tune the better. The BBC, fantastic as it has been seems to be being gutted from the inside by the likes of Apple from one side, and the conservative government on the other - you can hear the difference too - to me every show sounds like it’s been rushed together. That wouldn’t be too far off the mark too with most of the specialist DJs supplementing their income with record labels, club nights and more - somehow this doesn’t seem to be in line with the BBC’s impartial judgement?

Has the power that once reverberated around main stages at festivals, and echo out of bedroom windows, and pump through the veins of all of us, simply vanished in the name of progress? Are Buzzfeed, Facebook and Twitter a natural course of our biological evolution?

The existential problem that we face as humans is our inability to express ourselves in ways which convey exactly the way we are inside. Wether your medium is fashion, business, language, dance or music - the struggles are always there. The inability to find the perfect clothes, the conundrum of no money is never enough, the lack of the perfect emoji, the routine you didn’t create. The song that doesn’t express what you wish to say. 

We feel things might get close for fleeting moments, but only for us then to despise what was created minutes later. This manifests itself in infinite ways - from haircuts.

Humanity has struggled with this battle for eternity, Wolf Of Wall Street, Van Gough . Those which are the nearest to perfection in their own form are called masterpieces. Masters will know the feeling however, even if you feel you have almost contained the infinite - there is infinitely more that could be said.

 It is this problem that makes it hard for anyone who is creating anything to deem it complete. A musician feels a certain way - tunes (where is the origin of the word ‘tune’?!) into that, and channels it into a form of rhythmic, melodic, harmonic poetry, but to claim perfection in the process would be impossible because it is trying to express what is essentially infinite into a finite form. 

It is this same problem that I have been troubled by whilst writing this book. To put into words a commentary and discussion on a form that is in itself aiming to express the infinite leaves me with a paradox that is hard to address, and I will no doubt come up infinitely short as a result - but all I can do is write for the purpose of getting what is within out - if it resonates with another, then that is a bonus.

It is for this reason that I must erect clear boundaries within which I intend to write this commentary, knowing full well that the boundaries could never be too wide for what I know to be true, I encourage the reader to take from this the parts that resonate, and not to judge the parts which don’t. There will be exceptions completely opposite to every conclusion that I make within these pages, which is why drawing your own conclusions for what you know to be true to you at this particular moment is the most important part.

The problem I would like to address, which is boundary, or framework number one, is the need for incredible musical expression in this world - experienced by both performers and listeners. The power of this medium is undeniable, yet has been stifled to the point of regression.

It is this regression that I wish to address, and suggest some simple mechanical steps which might help to nurture this intangible magical phenomenon into a revival. Mechanical steps with something intangible? Yes -

Unlocking the power of music. The musical skeleton key. Tuning into the power of music. The code to the power of music.

The reason radiohead is quite an apt name is…..

The way you’d be like radiohead is to tune into certain things - that might make 

CHARLIE YOU WILL NEVER FIND THE PERFECT MEDIUM FOR EXPRESSION - YOU JUST NEED TO PICK ONE AND WORK WITH IT. YOU SEEM TO HAVE A WAY WITH WORDS AND SPEAKING, SO GO WITH THAT - YOU’VE TRIED MUSIC BUT IT DOESN’T WORK - HOPEFULLY YOU CAN FIND A WAY OF USING THAT WAY OF SPEAKING TO INSPIRE REAL CHANGE!

Even Buddha wasn’t satisfied with his expression?
